# A CNN and Entropy-Based Hybrid Model for Robust Deepfake Detection

<br>

**Live Demo:  [Click Here for Live Demo](https://entropyvision-ai.streamlit.app/)** <div id="top"></div>

<br>

## 📄 Overview

This project presents a novel hybrid deepfake detection model that integrates **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **entropy-based randomness analysis**. Designed to overcome the limitations of existing CNN-only models, especially against high-quality, fine-grained deepfakes, our approach significantly enhances classification reliability and reduces false positives.

Deepfake technology, while having legitimate uses in fields like education and entertainment, has been increasingly exploited for malicious activities such as **misinformation, identity fraud, blackmail, and online scams**. Traditional CNN-based detectors often struggle with advanced deepfakes due to their reliance solely on visual cues and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. 

Our hybrid model addresses this by combining the robust spatial feature extraction capabilities of DenseNet-121 with the statistical regularities identified through Shannon entropy, capturing inconsistencies inherent in GAN-generated images.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Hybrid Architecture:** Fuses a fine-tuned **DenseNet-121 CNN** with **Shannon entropy** values for a richer, more comprehensive understanding of image authenticity.
* **Enhanced Robustness:** Significantly improves detection accuracy against sophisticated, high-resolution deepfakes generated by advanced models like StyleGAN.
* **Attention Mechanism:** Integrates a **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention block** to intelligently weight image channels, making sure the model focuses on the most informative features.
* **Exceptional Accuracy:** Achieves an impressive **99.41% accuracy** on the test set, outperforming conventional CNN-based models.
* **Reduced False Positives:** Dramatically lowers the number of times advanced deepfakes are mistakenly classified as real, a critical improvement for real-world reliability.
* **Extensive Dataset:** Trained and validated on a massive dataset of **140,000 high-resolution images**, including 70,000 real images from Flickr-Faces-HQ and 70,000 fake images generated by StyleGAN, ensuring robust learning.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- Python 3.8+ (preferably 3.11)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
   
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dharambirsinghsidhu/EntropyVision_Deepfake_Detector.git
    cd EntropyVision_Deepfake_Detector
    ```

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Python Dependencies:**

    First, ensure your `pip` installer is up to date, then install the required Python libraries.

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install streamlit
    ```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## 📦 Model Download

Due to the substantial size of our pre-trained deepfake detection model, it is not directly included in this repository. Instead, the application is configured to **automatically download the model from Google Drive** the first time it's run, or if the model file is not found locally. This ensures a smoother setup while keeping the repository lightweight.

**How it works:**

When you run `app2.py`, it will check for the presence of the model file (e.g., in a `models/` directory). If it's missing, a download process will be initiated, typically displaying progress in your terminal. Please ensure you have an active internet connection during the first run. The model will be saved to a designated folder (e.g., `models/` or `weights/`) within your project directory for future use.

## 📚 Appendix: Alternative Web Interface (`app.py`)

In addition to the Streamlit application, this project also includes an alternative web interface built with HTML/CSS and potentially powered by Flask (`app.py`). This interface offers a different approach to interacting with the deepfake detection model, showcasing flexibility in deployment options.

<br>

## 💡 How to Run the HTML/CSS Interface

1.  **Ensure you have activated your virtual environment** (as described in "Local Setup and Installation").
   
2.  **Navigate to your project's root directory** in the terminal.
   
3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**

    First, ensure your `pip` installer is up to date, then install the required Python libraries.

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
7.  The application should then be accessible in your web browser, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or a similar local address indicated in your terminal.
